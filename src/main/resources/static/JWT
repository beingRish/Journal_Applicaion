JWT(Json Web Tokens) is a way to securely transmit information between parties as a JSON object
JWT is a compact, URL-safe token that can carry information between parties.
A JWT is a string consisting of three parts, separated by dots:
Header
Payload
Signature

The header typically consists of two parts: the type of the token(JWT) and signing algorithm being used, such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA.
                        {
                            "alg": "HS256",
                            "typ": "JWT
                        }

The payload contains the claims. Claims are statements about an entity(typically, the user) and additional metadata.
                        {
                            "email": "email.gmail.com",
                            "name": "John Doe",
                        }

The signature is used to verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is and to ensure that the message wasn't changed along the way.
To create the signature part, you have to take the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret, the algorithm specified in the header, and sign that.
                        HMACHA256(
                            secret,
                            base64UrlEncode(header) + "." + base64UrlEncode(payload)
                        )
